<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## Introduction

RealBloom is a sophisticated bloom simulation tool for achieving more realism in 3D renders and HDR images.

![RealBloom Screenshot](images/2-main-conv.png)

RealBloom was started as a hobby project in late August 2022, inspired by [AngeTheGreat's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWqb5Gewbx8) on bloom and how to simulate it in a physically accurate manner. **I highly recommend watching this video** to get a basic understanding of how RealBloom works. Make sure to check out their [GitHub page](https://github.com/ange-yaghi) and their other projcets!

The ultimate goal is to achieve more realism in 3D renders that contain bright spots on dark backgrounds. For example, the sun in a blue sky, a car headlight at night, bright lights at a concert, a flashlight pointing directly at the camera, you name it. RealBloom can be used to produce some other effects, including film halation, uniform lens blur, etc.

### How It's Made

RealBloom is written in C++ with Visual Studio 2022. The target platform is Windows. However, considering all the libraries used and most of the code for RealBloom are platform-independent, it should be fairly easy (ish) to port to other major desktop platforms.

RealBloom uses the following libraries:
| Library | Used for |
|--|--|
| [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/) | OpenGL extensions |
| [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) | Window and context creation for use in ImGui |
| [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) | Graphical user interface |
| [NFD Extended](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended) | Native file dialogs |
| [OpenColorIO](https://opencolorio.org/) | Color management |
| [OpenImageIO](https://sites.google.com/site/openimageio/) | Reading and writing images |
| [PocketFFT](https://github.com/mreineck/pocketfft) | 2D Fast Fourier Transforms |
| [dj_fft](https://github.com/jdupuy/dj_fft) | 2D FFT on the GPU |
| [pugixml](https://pugixml.org/) | Parsing and serializing XML files |
| [Rapidcsv](https://github.com/d99kris/rapidcsv) | Parsing CSV files |

<!-- RUNNING -->
## Running RealBloom

RealBloom requires [Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) to run properly. Chances are you already have it installed, though. To get RealBloom, you can [download the latest release here](https://github.com/bean-mhm/realbloom/releases).

### Minimum Requirements

 - 64-bit version of Windows

 - 4 GB of RAM

 - GPU with OpenGL 3.2 support

<!-- USAGE -->
## Using RealBloom

Check out [this page](USAGE.md) for a step-by-step tutorial on getting started with RealBloom, along with more details and information about the project. This will cover most of what you need to know.

<!-- BUILDING -->
## Building RealBloom

### Prerequisites

The project was made for Windows and built with MSVC, so you're going to need Windows. To build a local copy of RealBloom, have a version of Visual Studio ready.

### Build

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bean-mhm/realbloom.git
   ```

2. Open the solution (`RealBloom.sln`) in Visual Studio.

3. `RealBloom` is the main project, while `RealBloomGpuHelper` is a GPU helper that gets used by the main program.

4. Build the solution and run `RealBloom.exe`. Feel free to explore and play with the code!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Color Management System
- [x] OpenEXR support
- [x] Command Line Interface
- [x] GPU Dispersion
- [ ] [WIP] GPU FFT Convolution
- [ ] GPU Image Transforms
- [ ] Node-based workflow
- [ ] ~~Support for animated apertures, kernels and input images~~ 
- [ ] ~~GPU Diffraction Pattern~~

See [open issues](https://github.com/bean-mhm/realbloom/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Nodes

I have in mind to make RealBloom's interface more generic and robust by making it node-based. Here's the concept represented using Blender's node system:

![Node-based approach](images/3-nodes.png)

Unfortunately, I can't afford the time to work on this as of now, but I do plan on doing it whenever possible. If you do have the time and some knowledge on node-based applications, feel free to fork the repo and work on it, which would be really appreciated!

For some initial ideas, there could be a specific text format - based on XML, JSON, or anything else - for representing nodes, a core library that runs a node-tree, and a GUI for creating, managing, and displaying nodes.

Nodes could have unique IDs, cached buffers that only get reprocessed when the node's input parameters change, status and progress indicators, etc. You can see some example nodes in the image above.
